      <p>I am an ambitious and determined individual with a passion for learning who is on a journey from being a CDL truck driver to a nodejs programmer. I have a strong
        work ethic, and am self-motivated.</p>
      <p>As a truck driver I am used to working in a time sensitive, and fast paced environment. I am used to haveing to problem solve on my feet in a situation while paying attention
        to many details at one time. These attributes will help me excell in the world of programming</p>
      <p>While it will not be an easy transtion, I am confident in my ablities to learn and grow rapidly in this field. I understand perspectives from the deveops side as well because for
        several years now i have ran a home lab with several servers and virtual machines. Working with containers like docker and how to create docker files is something I am familiar with.
      </p>
      <p>With my work in the Trucking field I have worked as a team driver, and am used to working with others, and having others rely on me to do my job. I believe that I will bring
        a unique perspective to the table, and will be a valuable asset to any team I am a part of. I am learning more with every line of code I write, and am excited to see where this journey 
        takes me.
